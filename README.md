# Project
This repository is a way for me to explore by using VCS and GitHub Desktop to see if I have an understanding of how to use them together.
I can now see my cloned repository.
I need to figure out how commit from VCS to GitHub.
I will try that now.
Using Video Code Studio to check out how it works
Hoping this will be a success.
This is week 1 in my class to learn how to code.
I feel like I am understanding some of how GitHub and GitBash work, however, I am still struggling with VCS.
I also feel like I am just typing text and that I have no clue the language of code.
I think there are several languages to choose from such as, C++, JavaScript and Python.  
I have heard of these but have no a clue about any of them.
I am looking forward to learning.
